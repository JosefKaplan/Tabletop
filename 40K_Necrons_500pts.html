DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units never gain a Dynastic Code.  You can include a maximum of one C'TAN SHARD model in each NECRONS Detachment in your army.

                    <span class="bold">Command Protocols:</span>
                     If every unit from your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT, C'TAN SHARD and UNALIGNED units) is from the same dynasty, and you select a NOBLE model to be your WARLORD, this unit is eligible to benefit from this ability and the following rules apply.  <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After both sides have deployed, but before you have determined who will have the first turn, you must assign a different one of the command protocols to each of the first five battle rounds, and note this down secretly on your army roster.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    At the start of each battle round, if any NOBLE units from your army are on the battlefield, the command protocol that you assigned to that battle round becomes active for your army until the end of that battle round. Each command protocol is made up of two directives. When a command protocol becomes active for your army, reveal it to your opponent and select one of its directives. Until the assigned command protocol stops being active, while a unit that is eligible to benefit from this ability is within 6" of a friendly NECRONS CHARACTER model (excluding C'TAN SHARD models), that unit benefits from the selected directive.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If the battle lasts for more than five battle rounds, then until the end of the battle, whichever command protocol was active in the fifth battle round remains active.

                     A player controls an objective marker if they have any models with this ability within range of that objective marker, even if there are more enemy models within range of that objective marker. If an enemy model within range of an objective marker also has this ability (or a similar ability), then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range of that objective marker as normal.

                    <span class="bold">Reanimation Protocols:</span>
                     Each time an enemy unit shoots or fights, after it makes its attacks, if any models in this unit were destroyed as a result of those attacks but this unit was not destroyed, this unit's reanimation protocols are enacted and those destroyed models begin to reassemble.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Each time a unit's reanimation protocols are enacted, make Reanimation Protocol rolls for that unit by rolling a number of D6 equal to the combined Wounds characteristics of all the reassembling models. Each Reanimation Protocol roll of 5+ is put into a pool. A Reanimation Protocol roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If the number of dice in that pool is greater than or equal to the Wounds characteristic of any of the reassembling models, select one of those models to be Reanimated. A Reanimated model:<br/>
                    	-Is added back to its unit with its full wounds remaining.<br/>
                    	-Can only set up within Engagement Range of enemy units that are already within Engagement Range of the Reanimated model's unit.<br/>
                    	-Cannot, if it is your Charge phase, be set up closer to any enemy units that are targets of a charge declared by its unit this phase.<br/>
                    	-No longer counts as having been destroyed for the purposes of Morale tests this turn.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    You then reduce the number of dice in that pool by a number equal to the Wounds characteristic of the Reanimated model and repeat this process until either there are no more reassembling models, or the number of dice remaining in the pool is less than the Wounds characteristic of any of the reassembling models. Any models that did not Reanimate fail to reassemble, and any dice remaining in the pool are discarded.
